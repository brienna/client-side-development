# Project 3: Consume a web service

Repeats what I did for Project 2, but creating a C# front-end that accesses the same RESTful services as in Project 2. 

## Requirements 

- Write search functionality to obtain a specific organization, once that is obtained you will ask the web service for the pertinent data
    - All functionality is handled by your calls to appropriate services
    - The API for the services is available at http://www.ist.rit.edu/api
    - The interface is responsive to the data
- It should work just like project 2!
- Professional graphics (well, the best you can do)
    - Solution can be either WPD or WinForm
- Include comments in the code to clearly explain functionality

**I created this project using Visual Studio 2017 on a Windows 10 virtual machine, using VMware Fusion and MacOS Sierra.**
